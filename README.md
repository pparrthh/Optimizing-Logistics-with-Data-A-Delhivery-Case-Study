# Optimizing Logistics with Data: A Delhivery Case Study

## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive case study on Delhivery, Indiaâ€™s largest logistics provider, focusing on enhancing data processing capabilities. The project applies advanced data engineering and feature engineering techniques to clean, transform, and analyze complex logistics datasets. The goal is to derive meaningful insights that improve operational efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and refine route planning.

## Project Structure
- **Delhivery_Case_Study.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and hypothesis testing.
- **Data Folder**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for the analysis, detailing logistics operations such as trip times, distances, and route types.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Improve data quality by addressing missing values, duplicates, and standardizing formats for better analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as time differences, route-specific aggregations, and categorical splits to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform statistical tests to compare actual trip times against predicted times and identify significant deviations.
- **Operational Insights**: Identify key patterns in logistics operations, such as the busiest routes, average trip times, and usage of different route types.

## Key Findings
- **Busiest Corridors**: Identified the most active source-destination pairs, providing insights into where Delhivery's resources are most concentrated.
- **Time Efficiency**: Analysis of trip durations revealed opportunities to optimize routes, particularly on high-volume corridors.
- **Route Type Usage**: The prevalence of Full Truck Load (FTL) routes over Carting routes suggests a focus on long-haul shipments.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal and daily patterns in logistics activity suggest opportunities for optimizing staffing and fleet deployment.

## Recommendations
1. **Route Optimization**: Focus on optimizing high-volume corridors by exploring alternative transportation modes and improving scheduling.
2. **Fleet Management**: Adjust fleet composition to better match the demand for long-haul vs. short-haul routes.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Use temporal patterns to allocate resources more effectively, especially during peak periods.
4. **Data Quality Improvement**: Continue to enhance data consistency and completeness, particularly in key operational fields.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to forecast demand, estimate transit times, and predict resource requirements.
